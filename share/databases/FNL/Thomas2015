activity of p73.|In this study|It has been shown that E2F1 acts as a transcriptional activator for p73.|Taken together|While p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human tumors|p73 is a major determinant of chemosensitivity in humans|We have previously characterized how p53 family proteins control the transcriptional regulation of the platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor (PDGFRB) and found that DeltaNp73alpha|Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that cisplatin removed DeltaNp73 from the PDGFRB promoter and recruited p53 and p73|Altogether our results showed that TQ mediates its growth inhibitory effects on ALL p53-mutated cells via the activation of a p73-dependent mitochondrial and cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathway which subsequently targets UHRF1|Unlike the TP53

HSF1-responsive gene expression by N-terminal truncated form of p73alpha.|Our data suggest that the N-myc gene modulates expression of p73|N-myc modulates expression of p73 in neuroblastoma.|In conclusion|In conclusion|Herein|p73alpha isoforms drive opposite transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of MYCN expression in neuroblastoma cells.|Therefore|p19ras brings a new twist to the regulation of p73 by Mdm2.|In contrast|Here we demonstrated that the p53 family member p63 controls a pathway for p73-dependent cisplatin sensitivity specific to these "triple-negative" tumors.

screened HNF-6 gene for mutations in 34 Japanese subjects with MODY/early-onset diabetes mellitus and 56 subjects with late-onset diabetes mellitus.|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and nature of mutations in HNF4alpha/MODY1|CONCLUSION: This study suggests that mutations in the HNF1A gene comprise about 9% of clinically diagnosed MODY subjects in southern India and a novel Arg263His mutation cosegregates with MODY in one family|The results of our study suggest that mutations in HNF3B are not a common cause of MODY in Japanese subjects|We have tested this hypothesis by screening a panel of 57 unrelated Japanese subjects with a clinical diagnosis of MODY for mutations in HNF3B.|On the other hand we confirmed that the Ala45Thr variant in NeuroD1/BETA2 may represent a susceptibility gene for type 1 diabetes but none of these genes revealed any MODY-specific mutations.|PXR concomitantly inhibits SHP gene transcription and maximizes the

HNF4alpha expression in response to cellular stress are discussed|The mechanism by which HNF1-mediated activation occurs seems to be transcriptional|The mechanism by which HNF1-mediated activation occurs seems to be transcriptional|Because PPARalpha levels are elevated in tissues expressing the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF4)|Additionally|Smad4 binding to the positive TBE1 c-myc element was

a peptide aptamer designed to inhibit the binding between Smad4 and LEF/TCF reduced c-myc expression and the growth rate of HepG2 cells.|In prostate cancers|TCF4 promoter analysis showed that HOXB13 does not regulate TCF4 at the transcriptional level.|However|Coordinated expression of cyclin D1 and LEF-1/TCF transcription factor is restricted to a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma.|Nuclear LEF-1/TCF expression was observed in 52% of all cases|These data indicate that the hAR gene is a direct target of LEF-1/TCF transcriptional regulation in PCa cells but also show that the expression of the hAR protein is suppressed by a degradation pathway regulated by cross-talk of Wnt to Akt that is likely mediated by Wnt-directed degradation of the B regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase|Finally|Wnt is a complex signaling pathway whose endpoint involves activation of transcription from LEF-1/TCF transcription factors and it is known to be involved in the development and progression of numerous human epithelial tumors including prostate cancer.|Physical and functional cooperation between AP-1 and beta-catenin for the regulation of TCF-dependent genes.|Aberrant
