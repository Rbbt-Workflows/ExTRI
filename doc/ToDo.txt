From our skype earlier:

- Send statistics of counts of sentences by TF and by TG to explore posible
  normalization problems
- Incorporate new consensus validation into pipeline
- Correct LPS and study other possible post processing issues
- Gene Life cycle plots for TFs using PMIDs from Martin
- Curation stack generation

Let me know if I missed something
