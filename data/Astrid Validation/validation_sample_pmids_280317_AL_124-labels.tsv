12511565:9:GATA6:VWF	GATA6	VWF	GATA6	VWF		p		We propose that NFY recruits HDACs to the VWF promoter|which may result in deacetylation of GATA6 as well as of histones in non-endothelial cells|thus leading to promoter inactivation.											
22120493:8:POU5F1:POU5F1	POU5F1	POU5F1	Oct4	Oct4		t		Through promoter mapping and chromatin immuno-precipitation assays|we found that Oct4 is a direct target of ??-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription and the binding site at -875/-881 of Oct4 promoter is critical for b-catenin/TCF-dependent expression regulation.											
10982026:4:MITF:MITF	MITF	MITF	MITF	MITF		t	TF	Promoter deletion and mutational analyses indicate that SOX10 can activate MITF expression through binding to a region that is evolutionarily conserved between the mouse and human MITF promoters.											
23202735:4:CDX2:CDX2	CDX2	CDX2	CDX2	CDX2		t		We report data implicating repression of the transcription factor KLF4 as important for the oncogenic activity of CDX2|and demonstrate that CDX2 differentially regulates KLF4 in AML versus colon cancer cells through a mechanism that involves tissue-specific patterns of promoter binding and epigenetic modifications.											
16585579:3:MYC:MYC	MYC	MYC				t|n	TG	By binding to the c-myc promoter(s)|C/EBPbeta represses c-Myc expression and|therefore|arrests T cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.											
8877731:7:NR3C1:IL2	NR3C1	IL2				up		Taken together with the finding that IL-2 but not PMA protects MLA-E7T from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis|our results indicate that IL-2 does not induce such a protection by repressing the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor.											
24587342:13:STAT5A:IL2	STAT5A	IL2				up		Taken together|our data suggest that FRA2 is a novel STAT5 target gene|regulated by IL-2 in activated CD4 T cells.
