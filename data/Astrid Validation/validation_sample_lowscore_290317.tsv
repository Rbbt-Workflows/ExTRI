19201832:5:SMAD4:CDK2	SMAD4	CDK2	Smad4	CDK2			up		Moreover|CDK2 is the predominant CDK that phosphorylates Smad2 on T8 in myeloma cells|leading to inhibition of Smad2-Smad4 association that precludes transcriptional regulation by Smad2.	_									
21411665:4:EGR2:PMP22	EGR2	PMP22	Egr2	Pmp22	u				Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the rat Pmp22 locus|we found a major peak of Egr2 binding within the large intron of the Pmp22 gene.	_
